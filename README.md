# Bikes on Rails

## Application Description
  This application developed for a WebDev 1 Course COSC 630. The Ruby on Rails application is intended to be a few page web app. My app is designed to allow a user to create an account and login, then to be able to view current bikes and view/create reviews for these bikes. The idea is to allow people to get a good idea of what type of bike they would want for those looking to get into the sport, and those looking to upgrade their current ride.

## Live Site
  The application is hosted at the following Heroku site : https://bikes-on-rails.herokuapp.com/

## Development Environment
  Developed using a Windows 10 machine. The Atom text editor was used to write all of the related code (ruby, html...etc). The Git Bash terminal was used to handle all version control with git, as well as any necessary database and deployment commands.

## Database
  PostgreSQL was utilized both in development and the production site to make the application scalable if necessary.
